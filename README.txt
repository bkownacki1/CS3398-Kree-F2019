# CS3398-Kree-S2019

Assignment_4:

Authors: Sam Pugh, Ben Kownacki, David Kim, Shelby J, Jesse Munoz.
  
Project Name:
  1. Texas State Parking Simulator
  
Description: 
  1. David Kim, Shelby Jordan, Sam Pugh, Ben Kownacki, Jesse Munoz.
  
  2. Texas State Parking Simulator with Maps Integration.
  
  3. We aim to bennefit the students at Texas State University. The hope is to alleviate Student/Faculty/Staff stress assiciated with getting a good parking spot on campus at any given time during the day depending on a variety of input factors.
  
  4. We hope to ease the burden of finding a parking spot on campus at any point during the day.
    
Technologies:
  1. Web Application, Javascript backend, Bootstrap HTML 5 front end.
  2. Google Maps API.
  3. Node.Js for server and Controller/Database integration. 
  4. SQL based database integration.
  
Main Features:
  Parking 101:
    1. Location of best proprability of free parking spaces in the respective lots.
    
        Stories: Parking Story Authored by Shelby J
    
  Migration Monitor:     
    1. Real time map feed shown By Google Maps API indicating additional Street Parking options at peak hours of the day.
    
        Stories: Parking Story Authored by Shelby J
  
Additional Feature Ideas If Time: 
  - Places most likely to get parking tickets without propper permit, display warnings in the GUI.
  - Congestion hazards around parking areas that may limit parking options.

• Retrospective For Sprint 1

What Went Well or maybe not?

  Team:

    - Participation from most team members was good. Most were responsive and reachable Via Slack while others were not which lead to issues. 

    - Class Time was used very effectively to plan and think ahead on what priorities needed to be made to bring about a working finished result.

    - Whole group seemed optimistic about new ideas and excited to learn about them rather than wanting to take the easy way.

    - Documenting what we did was difficult because in this first phase most of us did mostly research. This should get better in the next phase when research won't be as necessary and all progress should come in the form of code.
    
    - This was a difficult time but i think moving foward it should go better.


  Individual:
    Sam Pugh: 
      - Web Page was easy enough to implement and build, but was time consuming to style.  
        Google Maps API took some work to get functional across all browsers due to 
        Differences in Javascript Engines and back end rendering agents.

    Shelby:
      - Researching JS, HTML, node.js, and CSS took a long time because I have no experience with them. Due to my lack of
	knowledge, I feel as if I am not able to contibute to the project as much as I would like. If this had been a Java
	program, I could have spent this sprint assisting development instead of researching. I feel as if I chose the wrong
	group to be in or the wrong project.

    Ben:
      - Using the Google Maps API seemed really simple at first, yet I could not get it to work no matter what I tried. I ended up scrapping my attempt to add a map to my own HTML file and just using the one on the app's homepage. After I started using the app on the homepage I made a lot more progress and learned a lot more about JavaScript and the Maps API. 

    David:
      - Adding the javascript code to validate and gather the user input went well. Only downside is that it took a bit
	longer than I wanted.

    Jesse:
      - Learning everything took a little longer than expected but moving foward this should work out better.

Specs:
  (4 pts – Team) Four or more team bullets
  (5 pts – Individual) One bullet per team member. o 


What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?

What Can We do to Improve?

  Team: 
    - Zenhub boards need to be updated daily so the rest of the team knows what is going on. It was hard to gauge where the project was at due to this and required messaging On Slack to ensure this got done. All teammates need to monitor Slack and make prompt responses otherwise it hurts the entire group. 

  Individual:

    Sam Pugh: 
      - Improvements in Communication and evaluating team members requirements in design
        Phase before implementing features and enhancements. Features built into the 
        Web page may not be understood by the entire group causing confusion. Aim to fix 
        This by posting further guides and examples from the internet about how these
        Enhancements were thought of and implemented and explains this during meeting
        Times in class. 

    Shelby:
      - I would like to sit down or form a discord chat to go into every aspect of the design thus far from either Sam or
	Ben when they have time. I do not feel confident enough in my understanding of HTML, JS, CSS, node.js, and the APIs
	to jump into the project without potentially doing damage. I would prefer to have either Sam or Ben direct me what
	I can do to contribute at this point. I am frustrated with how much time it has taken me to understand the basic
	components of this project.

    Ben:
      - I need to spend more time working on the project outside of class days. A lot more progress would have been made if I was doing work on M/W/F/S/U instead of just T/H. I also need to get better about updating the Zenhub. Even when I finished a task I would not move it to done in Zenhub just because I didn't think of it and I need to remind myself to do that so we have a consistent burndown chart. 

    David:
      - Better time management. With work and other classes, I tend to focus on one class work more than others causing me to rush 	or do projects the last minute. Also I need to be on top of checking ZenHub and making updates.

    Jesse: 
      - I need to spend more time working on this project than worrying about work and other classes. I also feel that i need to communicate better with my classmates to understand best where i can help out.

Retrospective:
    Team: 
        * Communication on Projects continues to suffer a little bit. -> Sam
        

    Sam Pugh:
        o What Went Well or maybe not?
          Team: 
            * Team Illness has been a major time issue with finishing the assingments in the alloted time. 
            * Team Communication has been much better in this sprint. 
            * Timeline and tasks were completed in a much more timely mannor this time around.
        
          Sam:
            * Dealing With Constant eye problems has really taken away to much time from    project.
            * Attempting to make up over the weekend.
            * Everything else has been implemented quick and efficiently such as the drop down menu's and dynamic HTML integration for the parking lists.

        What Might We Do Better?
            Team:
                * Prioritizing task and underestimating time needed for individual tasks such as database integration. Some tasks are taking a long time and have sub tasks that are causing issues. 
                
            Sam: 
                * Communication, following up with team and not getting sick as often.
