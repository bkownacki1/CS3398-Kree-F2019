• Retrospective For Sprint 1

What Went Well or maybe not?

  Team:

    - Participation from most team members was good. Most were responsive and reachable
      Via Slack while others were not which lead to issues. 

    - Class Time was used very effectively to plan and think ahead on what priorities 
      needed to be made to bring about a working finished result.


  Individual:
    Sam Pugh: 
      - Web Page was easy enough to implement and build, but was time consuming to style.  
        Google Maps API took some work to get functional across all browsers due to 
        Differences in Javascript Engines and back end rendering agents.

What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?

What Can We do to Improve?

  Team: 
    - Zenhub boards need to be updated daily so the rest of the team knows what is going 
      on. It was hard to gauge where the project was at due to this and required messaging
      On Slack to ensure this got done.

  Individual:

    Sam Pugh: 
      - Improvements in Communication and evaluating team members requirements in design
        Phase before implementing features and enhancements. Features built into the 
        Web page may not be understood by the entire group causing confusion. Aim to fix 
        This by posting further guides and examples from the internet about how these
        Enhancements were thought of and implemented and explains this during meeting
        Times in class.

(1 pts - Team) One or more team bullets
(5pts – Team) One or more team bullets
(5 pts – Individual) One bullet per team member with specific,
measurable improvement action described
 -3 if I (or the graders) can't figure out what the improvement action is and how you expect to measure it.
