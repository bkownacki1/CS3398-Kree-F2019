# Doss-alt personal progress

Author(s): Shelby Jordan

Purpose: This directory is for keeping track of my personal progress of the sprints seperate from 
of the normal reporting on the boards.

It will hold a copy of my results from researching and testing new concepts as needed by the semester 
group project.
