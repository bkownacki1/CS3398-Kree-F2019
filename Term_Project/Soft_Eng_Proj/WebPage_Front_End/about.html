                <h2>Why is this even an issue?</h2>
                <p>Great question! The thing is, this issue was much worse in previous years; and, even though we all
                    suffer
                    through it now, Parking Services seems to be trying to make some progress towards a solution. This
                    can be
                    seen <u><a href="https://www.parking.txstate.edu/about/statistics.html" target="_blank">here</a></u>.
                    As you
                    may notice, for the Fiscal Year 2018, Parking Services sold just over 20,000 parking permits of all
                    types.
                    This, despite them having just under 12,000 parking spots across the San Marcos and Round Rock
                    Campuses. In
                    previous years, Parking Services sold about 5,000 more Perimeter Permits than in Fiscal Year 2018.
                    This
                    means that, although they are selling fewer Perimeter Permits, they still sell about 70% more
                    permits than
                    they have spots available for. All those spaces need to accomodate almost 45,000 people (about
                    40,000
                    Students plus over 4300 Faculty & Staff). That's a huge discrepancy.</p>

                <p>Of course not all the available spots will be used at all times, so it doesn't make sense to ensure
                    that a
                    space exists for every single permit, but Parking Services can still do a lot better to provide
                    parking
                    accomadations. For example, there have only been two parking garages or lots added to Texas State
                    since
                    2005, adding a total of about 1600 parking spaces. This is with Texas State's planning assumptions
                    of 1.5%
                    undergraduate student growth per year (about 600 additional students <b>per year</b>), per their
                    2017-2027
                    University Master Plan. In that same Master Plan, the University recognizes that there is a parking
                    shortage, but their solution is to add spaces <i>farther</i> from central campus and provide more
                    busing to
                    the campus core. They also admit that they are placing a priority not on student, staff, or
                    residental
                    parking, but paid visitor parking, "in proximity to high profile public destinations."</p>

                <p>What insights can we glean from the university's plan? Well, being that the LBJ Student Center paid
                    parking
                    garage accounts for nearly 20% of Parking Services' yearly income while accounting for just 5% of
                    its yearly
                    expenses, the University seems to be looking to take a model of easy profit over easy scholarship.
                    The fact
                    that the University is prioritizing paid public parking for people who will visit the University a
                    handful
                    of times over permitted Staff/Faculty and Student parking, which is utilized by tens of thousands of
                    people
                    daily, is something we find insulting.</p>

                <p>In fact, the Univerity's Master Plan only includes plans for an addtional 2,000 parking spaces from
                    now until
                    2027. Remember, they also plan to add about 6,000 students in that same time frame. The gains made
                    by these
                    additional parking spaces will be mitigated by the increase in student population and by the fact
                    that in
                    the previous sentence in their master plan, they state that they want to migrate parking away from
                    the
                    campus core to these new facilities. Many of our fellow Civil Engineering Faculty and Students will
                    concur
                    that moving away from single-level surface lots and towards multi-level garages is the correct way
                    to
                    maximize efficiency of space, but where the University gets it wrong is their plan to move this new,
                    more
                    efficient parking farther from where it needs to be.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>What's the Solution?</h2>
                <p>For us the solution is to work around the problem. Since we cannot hope to pursuade the Univerity to
                    add more
                    parking than they plan to (they, somehwat comically, self-assess 77% of parking spaces occupied on a
                    given
                    day during peak periods), we must do the best we can with what we have. That is why we, as the
                    designers of
                    this website and tool, have put so many hours into researching and developing a way for our fellow
                    Students,
                    Faculty, and Staff to take best advantage of the shoddy infrastructure that the University provides.
                    Throughout their Master Plan, the University asserts that there is no war in Ba Sing Se by using
                    flabberghastingly wrong or irrelevant statistics, which many people who regularly visit Texas State
                    can
                    identify as ridiculous. We hope that by utilizing this tool, you will be able to experience a small
                    amount
                    more ease in your commute.</p>

                <p>For the University, the solution is to turn many of the surface-level lots in central campus into
                    multi-level
                    garages accessable to students. We also would like to see new garages placed in closer walking
                    distance to
                    campus for all permit holders. Finally, the University needs to upgrade the surface-level commuter
                    lots
                    currently located far from the center of campus into multi-level garages to provide double the
                    current
                    parking capacity. To make Texas State University into a model for accessability and ease-of-use, the
                    University must double the number of spots it currently has available so that anybody who pays for a
                    permit
                    is guaranteed an easy-to-find spot within a reasonable distance of campus. If the university cannot
                    manage
                    that, it must sell fewer permits so those who pay for a spot will have one.</p>
